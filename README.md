# AmaraReach

> A clean, responsive web portal for Amaravati Communications to capture client ad-requests and follow up with tailored quotes.

## 🚀 Project Overview
**AmaraReach** guides your clients through:
1. Browsing 📋 the full suite of marketing services  
2. Selecting exactly what they need (Newspaper, Radio, TV/Cinema, Digital, Print Collateral)  
3. Submitting all the details (state, area, content, delivery dates, etc.)  
4. Letting your team review requirements and send a personalized quote  

No pricing is shown up front—your team will handle that after review.
